New Features (RMIT Elevator Simulator fork):
============================================

* Added NetworkWrapperController which sends events to a networked client and
listens for actions.
* Created new Event subclasses (Action and Percept) to represent actions
a client a has requested and new events of interest to clients
* Changed simulation end condition
* Added configuration file
* Hide old Controllers and some simulators by default

New Features in 0.4:
====================
Added an application icon.
Added the ability to have more than one type of car controller.
Added a time factor to the user interface to control the speed of the
real-time simulation.
Updated formatting of clock display.
Added a capacity setting for elevator cars.
Added animation of people getting on and off cars.
Added sensor behaviour for car doors.
Added an averaging feature for multiple simulations.  This makes the
random seed setting more useful.
Added additional error dialogs when the application encounters errors.
Many, many bug fixes.


New Features in 0.3:
====================
An ability to run blocks of simulations so results can be compared.
Basically, the application will run simulations outside of the
real-time clock.  The simulation increments each value by the
specified step value until every combination is tested.  A table of
results is produced that can show comparisons with two of the
ranges of parameters.
