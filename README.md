# RMIT Elevator Simulator #
## What is this repository for?

* Fork of [elevatorsim](http://sourceforge.net/projects/elevatorsim)
* Adapted original simulator to allow control over a network
* Forked from r162 (0.4+)
* Developed by final year RMIT CSIT students as part of their capstone project
under the supervision of A/Prof. Sebastian Sardina
### Changes from r162 (0.4+) version 

* Network connectivity to simulation; allows controllers to run outside simulator.
* Allows to change car destination while car is traveling.
* People repress floor button if unable to enter car due to lack of capacity.
* Generate special event when car passes through each floor while traveling.
* Many bugs fixed.
## Running the simulator

You can run the simulation via CLI, Maven, or inside an IDE like Eclipse. The main class is `org.intranet.elevator.ElevatorSimulationApplication`.

The easiest way is to just obtain the latest JAR file from the [release](https://github.com/ssardina-agts/elevator-simulator/releases) section. Alternatively, you can first produce the JAR file via Maven via `mvn clean package`, which will leave the JAR file under `target/`.

To get the options available:

```bash

[ssardina@Thinkpad-X1 elevator-simulator.git]$ java -jar target/elevator-simulator-1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar  -h
usage: elevator [-f <STAT_FILE>] [-g] [-h] [-j <JSON_PARAM>] [-s <SPEED>]
 -f,--filestats <STAT_FILE>   store statistics in a CSV file
 -g,--headless                create a headless instance
 -h,--help                    show this help
 -j,--json <JSON_PARAM>       JSON formatted parameter file for simulators
 -s,--speed <SPEED>           run simulation at speed factor times
                              real-time
``` 

Notes:

* In the csv file, one line will be appended to the file for every simulation that is run. The same csv file should not be used across different application versions.
* the JSON file contains various simulation configurations and a chosen  active one to be used. See example `simulator-params.json`

The application will generate `elsimsettings.json` in the working directory if it does not already exist:

* `port` is the port the server will listen for a connection on
* `timeout` is the time in seconds the server will wait for communication from a client before trying to throwing an error
* set `enableOldControllers` to true to enable MetaController and SimpleController which do not run over the network
* set `enableHiddenSimulators` to true to enable some old simulators from the original project that were created for development purposes
### Simulation with GUI

If you have the JAR file, just do:

```bash
java -jar elevator-simulator-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

If you have cloned the source, you can just run the system via `mvn exec:java`

Once the application is up and running:

1. Select **File > New**.
2. Select **Random Rider Insertion** and click **Real time**.
3. Configure simulation settings to your liking or leave them at their defaults.
4. Select **NetworkWrapperController** under the **Controller** option.
5. Click **Apply**.
6. Run a client system (e.g., Java, Python, or SARL based) to connect and control the elevators.
7. Click **Go, Dude!** once the client is connected and the bottom left panel is showing statistics.
8. Adjust the time factor in the bottom right to speed up / slow down the simulation.
9. It is up to the client to control the elevator cars.

A log file `elevator-simulator.log` will be created and left at the end of the simulation.
### Headless simulation with no GUI

One can also run the simulator with no GUI display using the `-g` option:

```bash

java -jar target/elevator-simulator-1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar   -g
```

This will run the simulator as a server (so that controllers can connect as clients) in a default simulation (10 floors, 3 elevators of capacity 8 and 20 people).

One can specify various types of simulation configurations and the "active" one in a json file and use it as follows to run the simulator headless:

```bash

java -jar target/elevator-simulator-1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar  -j simulator-params.json  -g
```

See JSON file `simulator-params.json` for an example.
